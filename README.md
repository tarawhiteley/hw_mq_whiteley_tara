## Resources

I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

The biggest challenge I had with this assignment was realizing that the body tag also had to go inside of the media query, as well. Once I figured that out, my responsive design work.

This assignment was very helpful in putting into practice how media queries work. I'm anxious to use this in my portfolio website.
